A project for the pirate lovers to test their knowledge and have fun with other activities.

## Inspiration
As per the theme of the hackathon, we thought of building something to have fun with, therefore our team decided to make this amazing interactive quiz application to test whether the user is ready to be a pirate or not.

## What it does
The application has authentication enabled for the users through SAWO-labs API. It is very easy to log in using SAWO and the users will love it. After successful authentication, the user has three options to choose from which currently two of them are in production state while the third one is still in the development phase. The two options cover two types of quiz that are: Do you know them and Phrase up.
These are two different types of quizzes with their point system. The first option provides users with images of famous pirates and enables them to write their answers in the box given. Each correct answer has 2 points. Similarly, the other option has phrases that are used by the pirates and the user has to guess them out of the four given options. In the end, the user gets to know whether they can be a pirate or not.
The third option is the Pirate map generator for the users to build their own treasure hunt maps.

## How we built it
**Front-End**: Html, CSS, and Javascript
**Back-end**: Nodejs
**Authentication**: SAWO-labs API
**Hosting**: Qoom

The front-end development was handled by Ashutosh Baunthiyal and Priyanshu Bist.
The backend development of the project was handled by Karan Kartikeya.

## Challenges we ran into
It was the first time we were working in a team on a project and were unknown to each other's skills.
Therefore, we had a meet in which we introduced our skillset and took charge of the work assigned to each other. This was the first hackathon for the frontend team, therefore it took time how to integrating some pages. Also, it was the first time we were using SAWO-labs API and Qoom,  therefore there were some errors in the beginning but rectified them soon, all thanks to the great documentation of SAWO-labs.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have these interactive quizzes being deployed on Qoom for other users to have fun. We are also proud of our team's dedication towards building this project and enhancing it time and again with new features in the given time frame.

## What we learned
We learned teamwork distribution, work-load management, and many other great platforms like SAWO-labs, Qoom, and KoII.

## What's next for Pirate Heist
We will be working to deploy our application to a dedicated domain soon with our Pirate map generator option.
